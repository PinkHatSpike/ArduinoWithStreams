ArduinoWithStreams
====================

Arduino (Firmata) library for Processing, with added support for working with any InputStream and OutputStream.

Works with the StandardFirmata example included in the Arduino software distribution.  To use Firmata with other software, see [the Firmata homepage](http://firmata.org/).
